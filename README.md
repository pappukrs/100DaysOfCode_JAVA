## Once Upon a Time...

### Introduction
Once upon a time, there was a developer who fell deeply in love. He wasn't just a developer; he was an artist who crafted code with passion, bringing life to his projects. But one day, something unexpected happened—he fell for someone special. She was **pyari** (lovely), with a heart as **saaf** (pure) as the cleanest code. Her voice was like **pure water droplets**, soothing and clear, just like the feeling of a bug-free build. ❤️

### The Twist
The more he loved her, the more he believed their bond was as strong as his most solid code. They even planned to do **DSA** (Data Structures and Algorithms) together, dreaming of building solutions hand in hand. 💻 But one day, everything changed. The girl he adored chose someone else—a **cheater**—over him, leaving him heartbroken. She left him alone, just like an unclosed tag that ruins the entire layout of a webpage. 💔

### Coding to Cope
But he didn’t give up. Instead of letting the pain consume him, he turned to what he knew best—**coding**. Every day, with every line he wrote, he thought about her. In his pain, he found inspiration. He began writing **code poems**—his emotions woven into the syntax. If you look closely at his code, you can see the fragments of those poems, lines filled with longing and love. Every commit was a message, every push was a memory of her. ❤️

Not only did he write code for himself, but he also kept **pushing it into her directory**, just as they had planned to do DSA together. Even though she left, he continued writing code for **both of them**.

### #60DaysOfCode_JAVA with Remembering of Her
Through this journey, the developer started his **#60DaysOfCode_JAVA** challenge, writing code every day while thinking about her. Every algorithm solved, every Java function written carried a piece of the love he had for her. Each day was a reminder of the **DSA journey** they were supposed to take together. 💻💖

And so, he wrote code and pushed it to her directory, day after day. "Let's meet at Google," he thought, keeping hope alive in his heart. 

### Features
- **Beautiful UI**: Reflecting her beauty and the elegance of her presence. 💖
- **Smooth Transitions**: As soft and clear as her voice, like water droplets. 🌊
- **Code Poems**: Hidden within the codebase, you’ll find fragments of a heartbroken developer’s love and longing. ❤️
- **Daily Commits**: Continuing the DSA journey alone, but never forgetting their plan.

Each commit, each push is a testament to the love he still holds. Even though they are no longer together, he continues to **code for her** and **push in her directory**, keeping their shared dream alive, one line at a time. ❤️
